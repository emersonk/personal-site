### In progress project:

I'm unable to disclose specific details about the inner workings of the app, but I can give an overview of the project.

### Context:

Metabolic Insights (Mii) was founded with the goal of quantifying how the human body processes energy, particularly identifying periods of fat storage versus fat burning. This approach aims to model the body's response to specific foods and generate tailored meal plans aligned with individual health goals.

Since the inception of Metabolic Insights (Mii), I have been involved in the development of the technology, which initially focused on creating an electrochemical device capable of detecting multiple analytes in saliva without the need for reagents or consumables typical of a standard lateral flow assay. The project has since evolved to utilize a custom lateral flow assay to detect salivary insulin, a known regulator of metabolism. To support this, I developed a smartphone app that functions as the lateral flow assay reader.

### Experimental setup:

I find scientific and experimental programming on iOS can be cumbersome, especially for tasks like plotting and real-time data visualization. To streamline this, I created a project structure that leverages Python for data analytics, enabling rapid experimentation with algorithms and comprehensive verification and experiment tracking.

The core calculation logic is encapsulated within a dedicated framework, allowing it to be wrapped in a Swift executable and integrated into the Python analysis environment as well embedded into the app itself.

### Findings

I have not utilized this structure before, and it may already exist out there but this setup enables me to conduct testing, analysis, and plotting in Python while maintaining consistency with the appâ€™s actual logic. This structure ensures that the same code is deployed both in the application and during analysis, providing a reliable foundation for rigorous testing and experimentation. Much better than Swift playgrounds I find.
